# 🚀 GitHub Learning Program Notes

### Hi friends! 👋  
I'm starting a GitHub repo so we can collaborate on an awesome and complete set of notes.  

## Week One (March 31 - April 4): Foundations of Foundations 🧱

[GitHub Community Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/155153)

- Introduction to Git
- Introduction to GitHub
- Introduction to GitHub’s Products

## 🌟 What is Version Control?
Version Control Systems (VCS) are programs that track changes to a collection of files. The main goals of a VCS are:

- 🔄 Easily recall earlier versions of individual files or the entire project.
- 👥 Enable collaboration between team members, even on the same files, without interfering with each other’s work.

Also known as **Software Configuration Management (SCM)**, a VCS can be used for more than just software, including books and tutorials.

### 📝 Version Control
- A crucial development practice to track changes and revisions made by multiple developers working on the same project.

## 💡 Key Benefits of VCS:
- 📝 Track changes made to your project (when and by whom).
- 🗒️ Attach a message to each change to explain why it was made.
- 🔙 Retrieve previous versions of files or the whole project.
- 🌿 Create branches for experimental changes, which can be merged later.
- 🏷️ Tag versions, e.g., marking a new release.

## 🐙 Git: A Powerful VCS
Git is:
- ⚡ Fast
- 💪 Versatile
- 📏 Highly scalable
- 💸 Free and open-source

### 🌐 Git: The Most Popular VCS!
- ✅ A **distributed version control system** that allows multiple copies of a project to remain synchronized and up-to-date.
- 🌐 **GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that works hand in hand with Git, serving as a remote repo.
- 💼 Other features:
  - 👥 Collaboration
  - 📂 Management
  - 🤖 Automation
  - 📜 Revision
  - 🌟 Showcasing

#### 📌 Tracking Changes
- **Commits** are like snapshots of our code at specific points in time.
  - Each commit has a unique hash capturing changes.
  - **Branches** are chains of linked commits, allowing for multiple branches at a time to work on different features while keeping the main branch stable.
  - **GitHub Flow** - A lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports continuous deployment.

### 📌 Pull Requests
- A pull request signals that commits from one branch are ready to merge into another. 
- Reviewers verify the code, leave feedback, or make changes. 
- Once approved, the source branch is merged into the base branch.

#### 🗂️ Commands Used
- `git --version` - Check the installed version of Git.
- `git config --global user.name "<username>"` - Set the global username for Git commits.
- `git

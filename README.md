# 🚀 GitHub Learning Program Notes

### Hi friends! 👋  
I'm starting a GitHub repo so we can collaborate on an awesome and complete set of notes.  

## Week One (March 31 - April 4): Foundations of Foundations 🧱

[GitHub Community Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/155153)

- Introduction to Git
- Introduction to GitHub
- Introduction to GitHub’s Products

## 🌟 What is Version Control?
Version Control Systems (VCS) are programs that track changes to a collection of files. The main goals of a VCS are:

- 🔄 Easily recall earlier versions of individual files or the entire project.
- 👥 Enable collaboration between team members, even on the same files, without interfering with each other’s work.

Also known as **Software Configuration Management (SCM)**, a VCS can be used for more than just software, including books and tutorials.

### 📝 Version Control
- A crucial development practice to track changes and revisions made by multiple developers working on the same project.

## 💡 Key Benefits of VCS:
- 📝 Track changes made to your project (when and by whom).
- 🗒️ Attach a message to each change to explain why it was made.
- 🔙 Retrieve previous versions of files or the whole project.
- 🌿 Create branches for experimental changes, which can be merged later.
- 🏷️ Tag versions, e.g., marking a new release.

## 🐙 Git: A Powerful VCS
Git is:
- ⚡ Fast
- 💪 Versatile
- 📏 Highly scalable
- 💸 Free and open-source

### 🌐 Git: The Most Popular VCS!
- ✅ A **distributed version control system** that allows multiple copies of a project to remain synchronized and up-to-date.
- 🌐 **GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that works hand in hand with Git, serving as a remote repo.
- 💼 Other features:
  - 👥 Collaboration
  - 📂 Management
  - 🤖 Automation
  - 📜 Revision
  - 🌟 Showcasing

#### 📌 Tracking Changes
- **Commits** are like snapshots of our code at specific points in time.
  - Each commit has a unique hash capturing changes.
  - **Branches** are chains of linked commits, allowing for multiple branches at a time to work on different features while keeping the main branch stable.
  - **GitHub Flow** - A lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports continuous deployment.

### 📌 Collaboration in GitHub
Collaboration is at the core of everything GitHub does. Repositories help organize projects and files, while pull requests keep track of changes. In addition to PRs, GitHub also supports collaboration through Issues and Discussions.

#### Issues
GitHub Issues track ideas, feedback, tasks, or bugs. They can be created from various sources: task lists, project notes, PR comments, lines of code, or URL queries.

- To create an issue from a repository:
  - Navigate to the repository's main page.
  - Select **Issues** → **New issue**.
  - Fill in the title and description fields.
  - Optionally, assign it, add to a project, or label it.
  - Click **Submit new issue**.

#### Discussions
Discussions facilitate open conversations not directly related to code, like Q&A, ideas, polls, or announcements. To enable discussions in a repository:

- Navigate to **Settings**.
- Scroll to **Features** and select **Setup discussions**.
- Customize the template for your community.
- Click **Start discussion**.

Discussions can be categorized, and each category must have a unique name and purpose, such as Announcements, General, Ideas, Polls, Q&A, or Show and Tell.

### 🌐 GitHub Platform Management
Managing notifications and subscriptions is essential for staying updated on project activities. You can subscribe to threads or receive updates on issues, PRs, CI activity, and discussions.

#### GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites directly from a repository. It takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from your repo and publishes them as a website. Simply edit and push changes to keep your project site updated.

## 🌍 Distributed Version Control
Older VCSes (like CVS, SVN, Perforce) used a centralized server, risking a **single point of failure**. In contrast, **Git is distributed**:
- 🗂️ A complete project history is stored both on the client and server.
- ✈️ You can work offline and sync changes when online.
- 💾 You don’t need a server to use Git, although servers make sharing easier.
